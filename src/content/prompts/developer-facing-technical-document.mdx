Create a **developer-facing technical document** that explains how each **evaluation API** in this codebase is implemented at the code level.

**Goal**

* Help an engineer quickly understand *how the evaluation logic works internally*
* Serve as a **formal code documentation artifact** suitable for review or submission

**Format**

* Output **Markdown**
* Structured, concise, and skimmable
* Written for engineers (not users)

**For each evaluation API, include:**

1. **Purpose & Scope**

   * What this evaluation measures
   * When and why it is used
2. **Public Interface**

   * Function/class name
   * Inputs (types, shapes, units, assumptions)
   * Outputs (types, units, aggregation rules)
3. **Internal Implementation**

   * Step-by-step logic flow
   * Key algorithms or formulas
   * Important thresholds, constants, or heuristics
4. **Data Flow**

   * How data enters, is transformed, and exits
   * Dependencies on other modules or shared utilities
5. **Edge Cases & Failure Modes**

   * Invalid inputs
   * Missing data
   * Numerical or logical pitfalls
6. **Performance Characteristics**

   * Time / space complexity (qualitative is fine)
   * Known bottlenecks or scaling concerns
7. **Design Rationale**

   * Why this approach was chosen
   * Trade-offs vs alternative implementations
8. **Example**

   * Minimal, realistic usage example (pseudo-code or real code)

**Global Sections**

* High-level architecture of the evaluation layer
* Common patterns shared across evaluation APIs
* Known limitations and TODOs

**Style Guidelines**

* No marketing language
* Prefer concrete explanations over abstraction
* Assume the reader can read code but hasn’t seen this project before
* Avoid repeating obvious code comments unless they add context

**Do not**

* Explain basic Python syntax
* Restate function names without explanation
* Add speculative behavior not present in the code


> If an implementation is unclear or inconsistent, explicitly call it out instead of guessing.
