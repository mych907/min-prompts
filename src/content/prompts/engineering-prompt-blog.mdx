### Raw Prompt

Give me a prompt to implement my personal website - I'm going to use it as my personal engineering prompt saver.

### Enhanced Prompt

Here is a comprehensive prompt you can copy and paste into a generic coding LLM (like Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o) to generate your website.

I have chosen a **Static Site Generator (Astro)** approach for this.
*   **Why?** It is incredibly fast, free to host (GitHub Pages/Vercel), and "posting" is as simple as dropping a Markdown file into a folder. It is the gold standard for engineering blogs right now.

### The Prompt to Copy/Paste

> **Act as a Senior Frontend Engineer.** I need to build a personal "Engineering Prompt Saver" website. This will be a lightweight blog/library where I store useful LLM prompts, code snippets, and engineering notes.
>
> **The Tech Stack:**
> *   **Framework:** Astro (latest version)
> *   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
> *   **Content:** MDX (Markdown + JSX)
> *   **Interactivity:** React (only where necessary)
> *   **Deployment:** Vercel
>
> **Key Features Required:**
> 1.  **Homepage:** A clean grid or list of recent prompts.
> 2.  **Categorization:** A sidebar or top bar allowing me to filter content by "Category" (e.g., *Coding, DevOps, Writing, Email*) and "Tags" (e.g., *Python, AWS, Regex*).
> 3.  **Search:** A simple client-side search bar to find prompts quickly.
> 4.  **The "Post" View:**
>     *   Must render Markdown code blocks nicely with syntax highlighting (Shiki).
>     *   **Crucial Feature:** Every code block/prompt block must have a "Copy to Clipboard" button in the top right corner.
> 5.  **Dark Mode:** Default to system preference, but include a toggle.
>
> **Deliverable:**
> Please provide the project structure and the code for the essential files:
> *   `astro.config.mjs`
> *   `src/layouts/Layout.astro`
> *   `src/pages/index.astro` (Homepage with search/filter)
> *   `src/components/PromptCard.astro`
> *   `src/layouts/MarkdownPostLayout.astro`
> *   A sample MDX file showing how I should format my frontmatter (title, tags, category).
> *   The logic for the "Copy to Clipboard" button.
>
> Keep the design minimal, utilitarian, and high-contrast (engineering aesthetic).
